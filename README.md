# iOS-Portfolio-Mendoza22
Hello my name is Angel Mendoza and this is my portfolio of the projects that I've made throughout High School. I got interested in Computer Science when I realized you could create your own Games and apps. My first introduction to making games was Scratch and it's this cool website where you could make your own games, with simplistic code that I knew. Then I got introduced to Computer Science Principles in my early years in High School, and it was way different than Scratch. I honestly struggled trying out the new code and algorithms; MIT was the app/software that I used to make my games. I first made a clicker game which was about tapping the ballons and they would pop, but if you popped the wrong ballons you would lose a life bar. The second and last game I made in MIT Maker was a Story Choice game that I fell in love with. I was proud about this game because I made most of the artwork in the game and it was functional. In 11th Grade I wanted to team up with a partner that time, So Even L and I decided to make a knock off Pokemon game. He was the coder and I was the Artist in making the game. In my latest creation I decided to go for something much more simple this time around. I made an app where you can find out what your cat's age is in Cat years.

In the coding that I did I used math Integers to mulitpy a Humans age by 7 since cats age faster than humans EX~ 1x7=7, 2x7=14.

Back in 9th Grade I worked on a Story Choice game called The Origins of Vimo. This was a game where you read and make different choices with mulitple endings.

In my second Term I worked with a team with Elliot Jackson, Adhava, Pranay and Me. They wanted to make a Tower Defense kind of game. I was in charge of making the assets. I made the Towers and enemies. I also made a cannon that shot enemies from afar. This was sorta an animation I did. The original idea was to make the game similar to Bloons TD another defense kind of game. I was mainly working on creating the artwork of the characters in the game, so I didn't really code in this term
